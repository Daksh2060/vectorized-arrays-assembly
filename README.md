# Vectorized Arrays Demo Assembly

This Assembly project involves using the SIMD AVX2 insturction set to vectorize arrays of floats. The project implmenets a dot product function and a polynomial mapping function, with a 32-bit and 64-bit version for each. The Dot product function returns the doto product of two equal sized arryas of either signle or double rpeciosion float values, while the polynomial mapping function passes each indice through a polynomial. The AVX2 insturction set has been used to drastically speed up the proccess, by using projections and horizontal operations to reduce the number of steps required. A C implementation of each function has been included for comparsion.
